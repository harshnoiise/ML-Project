  The three algorithms applied to the scraped data from the New York Times are K-Means, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.
  
  To compile K-Means Clustering:
  >> python kmeans-nytimes.py
  
  To compile Decision Tree Classification:
  >> python dt-nytimes.py
  
  To compile Random Forest Classification:
  >> python randomforest-nytimes.py
